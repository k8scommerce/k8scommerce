## Getting Started

K8sCommerce can be run in multiple ways:

- **Local single-node kubernetes kind cluster:** Recommended for evaluating K8sCommerce - [instructions]()

- **Deployment to your existing cluster:** Recommended for testing & production - [intructions]()

- **Running Clusterless:** Recommended for local development - [intructions]() 


### Quick Start
Deployment to a k8s cluster using the K8sCommerce Operator.

```sh
# Install RabbitMQ Operator for messaging
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/releases/latest/download/cluster-operator.yml

# Install K8sCommerce Operator
kubectl apply -f 
```

## Project Development Philosophy

The K8sCommerce project embraces the development philosophy: *"Prefer tools over conventions."*

Employing code-generation tools as often as possible reduces repetitively writing foundational code such as CRUD operations, gRPC bindings, microservice boilerplate code. This methodology shortens the developer's learning curve while reducing human-introduced bugs.

Incorporating the following code-generation tools in our projects has helped speed up development, integrations, and logic refinements, creating a desirable, streamlined, high-velocity development approach.

- [Google's protocol buffers (protoc)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/): RPC client/server generation from .proto files with almost every language supported
- [go-zero's goctl](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero): microservice framework generation from .proto files
- [xo's xo](https://github.com/xo/xo): Database CRUD object generation for relational databases, with primary key, foreign key, enum, and advanced composite primary key support.

Preferring tools over conventions, combined with ever-growing documentation, empowers businesses to successfully integrate K8sCommerce's projects into their existing coding ecosystem in condensed timeframes.
